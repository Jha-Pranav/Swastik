    "**Total Starch:** Starch is a complex carbohydrate that is broken down into glucose during digestion. Foods that are high in starch, such as bread, rice, and pasta, can raise blood glucose levels after eating. However, the rate at which starch is digested and absorbed can vary depending on factors such as the type of starch and how it is prepared. Foods that contain fiber, such as whole grains and legumes, may have a slower impact on blood glucose levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fructose:** is a type of sugar that is found naturally in fruits and honey, and is also commonly used as a sweetener in processed foods and beverages. Consuming excess fructose can lead to insulin resistance and other health issues. While fructose itself does not raise blood glucose levels, it can still impact blood glucose levels indirectly by contributing to weight gain and insulin resistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Glucose:** is a simple sugar that is the primary source of energy for the body. Consuming foods that are high in glucose, such as sugary beverages and snacks, can cause a rapid increase in blood glucose levels. In response, the body releases insulin to help move glucose out of the bloodstream and into cells for energy. Over time, consuming excess glucose can lead to insulin resistance and other health issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sucrose:** Sucrose is a type of sugar that is commonly found in table sugar, as well as in many processed foods and beverages. Consuming foods that are high in sucrose can cause a rapid increase in blood glucose levels, similar to glucose.\n",

    "Sucrose\n",
    "Glucose\n",

    "Total Starch\n",
    "Fructose and sucrose have a significant impact on blood glucose levels because they are composed of monosaccharides (fructose and glucose) that are quickly absorbed into the bloodstream, leading to spikes in blood glucose levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Glucose is a monosaccharide and is the primary source of energy for the body, so it also has a significant impact on blood glucose levels, although it may be absorbed more slowly than fructose and sucrose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maltose is a disaccharide composed of two glucose molecules, so it also has a moderate impact on blood glucose levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Total starch is a complex carbohydrate that is broken down into glucose molecules during digestion, but it is typically absorbed more slowly than simple sugars and has a lower impact on blood glucose levels.\n",

    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the impact of carbohydrates on blood glucose levels can vary depending on several factors, including the amount and type of carbohydrate consumed, the individual's metabolic health, and other components of the diet. Therefore, it's difficult to provide exact quantitative values that apply to all individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we assume that all other factors are constant, here's a rough estimate of the impact of each carbohydrate on blood glucose levels on a scale of 0 to 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Total Starch: The impact of total starch on blood glucose levels can vary depending on the source and processing of the starch. Starchy foods that are minimally processed and high in fiber, such as whole grains, tend to have a lower impact on blood glucose levels than highly processed starchy foods, such as white bread. On a scale of 0 to 1, the impact of total starch on blood glucose levels might be around 0.4 to 0.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fructose: Fructose is metabolized differently than glucose and can contribute to insulin resistance, fatty liver disease, and other metabolic disorders when consumed in excess. On a scale of 0 to 1, the impact of fructose on blood glucose levels might be around 0.1 to 0.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Glucose: Glucose is the primary source of energy for the body and is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream, which can lead to spikes in blood glucose levels. On a scale of 0 to 1, the impact of glucose on blood glucose levels might be around 0.5 to 0.8.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sucrose: Sucrose is a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose, so it also has a significant impact on blood glucose levels. On a scale of 0 to 1, the impact of sucrose on blood glucose levels might be around 0.6 to 0.8.\n",
